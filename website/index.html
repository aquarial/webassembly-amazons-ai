    <p>
      An abstract strategy game with two teams taking turns back and forth. The last team to
      make a move wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a turn a player clicks 
      one of their pieces to select it, then clicks a location to move it,
      then clicks a location to
      place a 'stone' blocker pieces. Pieces and stones move like queens,
      and cannot move through other pieces/stones.

      The entire website
      will freeze up while the AI is computing. 
      I'm working on that.
      Be careful to click "Make AI Move" just once because
      otherwise it will make multiple moves one-after-another.
